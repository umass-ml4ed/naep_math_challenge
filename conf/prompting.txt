### Input:
#### Question

Use the following information to answer questions.
Phil's age is 3 times Alex's age.
Phil is 2 years old than Zach.
Tim is 6 years younger than Phil.

Which of the following statements will NOT be true exactly 10 years from now?
A. Phil's age will be 3 times Alex's age.
B. Phil will be 2 years older than Zach.

Explain why the statement you selected will NOT be true.

#### Correct Answer

A. Phil's age will be 3 times Alex's age.

##### Explanation for Part B
For example, let Alex's age now be 5. Then Phil's age would be 3 times 5, or 15. In 10 years, Alex will be 15 and Phil will be 25. 25 is not 3 times 15, so Phil's age will not be 3 times Alex's age.
